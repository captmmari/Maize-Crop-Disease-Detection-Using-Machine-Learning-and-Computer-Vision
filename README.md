# Crop Disease Detection Using Machine Learning and Computer Vision.


Plant disease is a major problem in plant growth. Farmers should take the utmost care to detect the diseases of the plant. But, early detection of plant disease may not be possible for farmers due to the lack of knowledge of the diseases. By creating an accurate image recognition model through machine learning, we aim to help the farmer to detect the diseases affecting maize plants.



Common types of maize disease:


## Northern leaf blight

A foliar disease of maize with its key characteristic being cigar-shaped lesions


## Common rust

The disease is caused by the fungus Puccinia sorghi. The fungus overwinters in an alternate host (a species of Oxalis) and releases spores during the spring


## Maize streak disease 

This is caused by a geminivirus and is widespread throughout the region. The virus is transmitted by the insect leafhopper Cicadulina spp. commonly found in fields of late-planted maizeâ€”to varieties that are susceptible to the disease.


## Gray leaf spot 

A foliar fungal disease that affects maize, also known as corn. GLS is considered one of the most significant yield-limiting diseases of corn worldwide. There are two fungal pathogens that cause GLS: Cercospora zeae-maydis and Cercospora zeina.


## Head smut

A fungal disease of corn plants that is caused by the pathogen Sphacelotheca reiliana. It is a systemic disease that can infect a plant as a seed but the symptoms do not appear until the plant is in its flowering and fruiting stages.
