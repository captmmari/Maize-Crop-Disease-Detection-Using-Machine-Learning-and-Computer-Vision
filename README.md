# Crop Disease Detection Using Machine Learning and Computer Vision.

## Description
A repository containing a model used to predict if a maize has a disease and the type of disease.

## Business Problem
Maize is a basic ingredient in many regions across the world. In addition to being consumed directly by humans, maize is also used for corn ethanol, animal feed and other maize products, such as corn starch and corn syrup. Maize plant diseases are a major problem in plant growth. Farmers should take the utmost care to detect the diseases of the plant. Plant age, pathogen species, and environment all play a role in symptom expression. The diseases are more common in humid, warm climates. Without early detection, these diseases spread rapidly, wiping out entire maize fields and severely impact  food security. By creating an accurate image recognition model through machine learning, we aim to help the farmer to detect the diseases affecting maize plants in order to mitigate the damage. 

### Common types of maize disease:
#### Northern leaf blight
A foliar disease of maize with its key characteristic being cigar-shaped lesions
#### Common rust
The disease is caused by the fungus Puccinia sorghi. The fungus overwinters in an alternate host (a species of Oxalis) and releases spores during the spring
#### Maize streak disease 
This is caused by a geminivirus and is widespread throughout the region. The virus is transmitted by the insect leafhopper Cicadulina spp. commonly found in fields of late-planted maizeâ€”to varieties that are susceptible to the disease.
#### Gray leaf spot 
A foliar fungal disease that affects maize, also known as corn. GLS is considered one of the most significant yield-limiting diseases of corn worldwide. There are two fungal pathogens that cause GLS: Cercospora zeae-maydis and Cercospora zeina.
#### Head smut
A fungal disease of corn plants that is caused by the pathogen Sphacelotheca reiliana. It is a systemic disease that can infect a plant as a seed but the symptoms do not appear until the plant is in its flowering and fruiting stages.


##Objectives
1. To identify if a maize plant has a disease or not
2. To identify the type of plant disease that the maize plant has using pictures.
